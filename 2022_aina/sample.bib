abstract="Machine Learning (ML) has been enjoying an unprecedented surge in applications that solve problems and enable automation in diverse domains. Primarily, this is due to the explosion in the availability of data, significant improvements in ML techniques, and advancement in computing capabilities. Undoubtedly, ML has been applied to various mundane and complex problems arising in network operation and management. There are various surveys on ML for specific areas in networking or for specific network technologies. This survey is original, since it jointly presents the application of diverse ML techniques in various key areas of networking across different network technologies. In this way, readers will benefit from a comprehensive discussion on the different learning paradigms and ML techniques applied to fundamental problems in networking, including traffic prediction, routing and classification, congestion control, resource and fault management, QoS and QoE management, and network security. Furthermore, this survey delineates the limitations, give insights, research challenges and future opportunities to advance ML in networking. Therefore, this is a timely contribution of the implications of ML for networking, that is pushing the barriers of autonomic network operation and management.",

abstract = {Microbursts can degrade application performance in datacenters by causing increased latency, jitter and packet loss. The detection of microbursts and identification of the contributing flows is the first step towards mitigating this problem. Unfortunately, microbursts are unpredictable and typically last for 10's or 100's of μs and the high line rates (> 10 Gbps) in modern datacenter networks further exacerbate the problem. In this paper, we show that modern programmable switching ASICs have made it practical to detect and characterize microbursts at high line rates. Our system, called BurstRadar, operates in the dataplane and monitors microbursts by capturing the telemetry information for only the packets involved in microbursts. We have implemented a prototype of BurstRadar on a Barefoot Tofino switch using the P4 programming language. Our evaluation on a multi-gigabit testbed using microburst traffic distributions from Facebook's production network shows that BurstRadar incurs 10 times less data collection and processing overhead than existing solutions. Furthermore, BurstRadar can handle simultaneous microburst traffic on multiple egress ports while consuming very few resources in the switching ASIC.},
